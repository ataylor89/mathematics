# Lesson 1: Definitions

The first lesson is to give mathematics a good definition

There are many good definitions

Here are some definitions that my family and I use

1. Mathematics is the language of numbers
2. Mathematics is the language of logic
3. Mathematics is the language of reason
4. Mathematics is education
5. Mathematics is truth
6. Mathematics is correctness
7. Mathematics is the study of mathematical objects

Mathematics is really a language, just like English and Spanish

When we learn the language of mathematics, we learn how to work with numbers, and we learn how to reason

A theory is a hypothesis

A fact is a truth

When we learn the language of mathematics, we learn how to evaluate a theory, and we learn how to prove that a conclusion is true

In my family we say, "Every investigation has a conclusion"

When we learn the language of mathematics, we learn how to investigate a question, and we learn how to form a conclusion

We can use proof to demonstrate that a conclusion is true

A proof is a correct argument

A proof is a sequence of statements (or steps) that demonstrates a conclusion is true

When we learn the language of mathematics, we learn about proof, correctness, problem solving, and logical thinking

These tools are invaluable

We can use these tools in everything that we do
