# squares

We can think of our mathematics journey as a series of steps

The first step is numbers; the second step, arithmetic; the third step, algebra; the fourth step, geometry

(We can enumerate these steps in any way we choose... this is just one way of enumerating them)

We can also think of our mathematics journey as a series of squares

Square one is numbers; square two, arithmetic; square three, algebra; square four, geometry

Both metaphors (squares and steps) are very useful

If we're on square three (algebra) and we are studying the equation x^2 = 2...

We arrive at the conclusion that x^2 = 2 does not have any rational solutions

(There is a proof that x^2 = 2 does not have any rational solutions, and we arrive at this conclusion after proof)

We can actually calculate the square root of two using a continued fraction

The square root of two is equal to the limit of a continued fraction

This limit exists, and it's actually a real number, an irrational number

Upon discovering the square root of two, we realize, we have to go back to square one

We return to square one, numbers

We say, "We just discovered an irrational number, the square root of two"

We have to expand our definition of numbers

Prior to discovering the square root of two, we had the concept of integers and fractions

After discovering the square root of two, we have the concept of integers, fractions, and non-fractions

(This is equivalent to saying, integers, rationals, and irrationals)

(A rational number is just the ratio of two integers, with one condition, that the denominator is not zero)

(An irrational number is a real number that is not rational)

So... after discovering the square root of two, we have to go back to square one

This is why the squares metaphor is very useful

Sometimes we have to go back to square one, square two, or square three, and expand our knowledge of numbers, arithmetic, or algebra

I wanted to share these metaphors on my Github

We can think of our mathematics education as a series of steps, or as a series of squares

When I was younger, I used to see people draw squares in public places, on the asphalt

They would draw squares one through ten, in chalk, on the pavement

I used to walk on these squares, and slowly make my way from square one to square ten, step by step

I am reminded of these memories while writing this document

When I talk about the squares metaphor, I think about these memories, of traversing ten squares outlined in chalk on the pavement

So... I want to wrap this up, and summarize this document

I was talking to my family last night about metaphors for math education

We talked about the squares metaphor and also the steps metaphor

We can think of our mathematics education as a series of steps

We can also think of our mathematics education as a series of squares

There are many ways of enumerating these squares, but one way is this:

Square one is numbers  
Square two is arithmetic  
Square three is algebra  
Square three is geometry  

When we reach geometry, and discover Pi, we will find reason to revisit square one, and renew our discussion of numbers
