# Lesson 4

In the last lesson, we calculated 327 + 468

What is 327 + 468?

It's an arithmetic expression

It is actually an arithmetic operation, an operation called addition

The operation consists of an operator (+) and two operands (327 and 468)

We determined that 327 + 468 = 795

What is 327 + 468 = 795?

It's an arithmetic equation

It's actually an equation

Listen

We can also say this

We can say that 327 + 468 = 795 is a mathematical sentence

We know every word in this sentence

We know that 327 is a number

We know that + is an operator

We know that 468 is a number

We know that = is a relation, specifically, the equality relation

We know that 795 is a number

Now, let's do long addition

We can do 327 + 468 in our heads, but we can also do long addition

Let's use long addition

```
  1
 327
 468
----
 795
```

There we go

We solved this problem using long addition

In the last lesson, we said, "It's hard to do 3681238 + 38649743 in your head"

I can do "327 + 468" in my head

But can I do "3681238 + 38649743" in my head?

Honestly, it would be very difficult to do 3681238 + 38649743 in my head

It would be so hard... I've never done a mental arithmetic problem that hard

So let's take a different approach

Let's use long addition

```
1111001
03681238
38649743
--------
42330981
```

We get an answer of 42330981

I checked my answer by pasting "3681238 + 38649743" into Google search

It turns out, our answer is correct

So we just did a very difficult addition problem using long addition

We were able to calculate 3681238 + 38649743 using long addition

It's actually very difficult to calculate 3681238 + 38649743 without long addition

If you ask me, I can only think of two good ways to calculate 3681238 + 38649743

1. Long addition
2. Using a calculator

When I searched it on Google, I was using Google's calculator

So I can really just think of two good ways to solve this problem

1. Long addition
2. Calculator

You can see why long addition is so useful

We can use long addition to solve very difficult addition problems

Long addition is a system for adding two numbers

The system works, even if the numbers are very large

So listen

In the last lesson, we talked about the rules of arithmetic

We can solve arithmetic problems using the rules of arithmetic

Long addition is a system for adding numbers and it's based on the rules of arithmetic

I can do 327 + 468 in my head

In order to calculate 3681238 + 38649743, I need to use long addition, or I need to use a calculator

It's important to know that long addition is based on the rules of arithmetic

Let's explain

```
327 + 468 = 300 + 20 + 7 + 400 + 60 + 8
327 + 468 = (7 + 8) + (20 + 60) + (300 + 400)
```

When we do long addition, we add seven and eight, and we carry the tens digit

We also add 2 and 6, and we carry the tens digit

We also add 3 and 4, and we carry the tens digit

So you can see how it works

Long addition is a system for adding two numbers, and it's based on the rules of arithmetic

The rules of arithmetic allow us to do long addition

We can be grateful that we know numbers

We can be grateful that we know a number system

I know and use five number systems:

1. Decimal
2. Hexadecimal
3. Binary
4. The tally number system
5. English nomenclature for numbers (like one, two, three, four, eight)

I can do arithmetic problems in my head

I can also do complicated arithmetic problems using long addition, long subtraction, long multiplication, and long division

In this lesson we learned long addition

I want to impart this wisdom

1. We know and use many number systems (like decimal, hexadecimal, binary, tally, etc)
2. We can do arithmetic problems in our head
3. We have a system for adding numbers called long addition, and we can use this system to add large numbers

So we have number systems...

We have a system for adding numbers (long addition)...

We actually have systems for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing...

These systems are called long addition, long subtraction, long multiplication, long division

The word system is very useful

It has many definitions

Here are some definitions of the word system:

1. A system is a list (e.g. system of equations)
2. A system of a list of instructions
3. A system is a procedure

A number system is a procedure for writing numbers

Long addition is a procedure for adding numbers

So listen

We have a system for writing numbers

We have a system for adding numbers

We can count our knowledge of mathematics, and add it to our mathematical treasure

We can count our knowledge of mathematics, and add it to our treasure chest

Knowledge is treasure

We can count our knowledge of mathematics, and add it to our treasure

We can treasure our mathematical knowledge

We can treasure what we know

Knowledge is a treasure, and we can count our treasure

Listen

I was really trying to arrive at the poem I wanted to write

Here's the poem I want to write

Knowledge is a treasure, and we can count our treasure

What does our treasure consist of thus far?

Thus far, our treasure consists of this:

1. We have systems for writing numbers (decimal, hexadecimal, binary, tally, the English language)
2. We know the rules of arithmetic
3. We have a system for adding numbers (long addition)

In the next lesson, we will talk about pemdas

PEMDAS is one of the rules of arithmetic

We haven't taught all the rules of arithmetic yet

We have taught some, but not all

We can discuss the rules of arithmetic in more detail, in the next lesson, including the order of operations

In the next lesson, we'll talk about PEMDAS
