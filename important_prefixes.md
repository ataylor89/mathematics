# important prefixes

My family taught me many important prefixes in the English language, that we often use in reasoning and analytical thinking.

I'll share these prefixes in a table, along with some examples.

| Prefix | Examples |
-------- | ---------|
List of | List of instructions (algorithm); list of statements (argument); list of steps (argument/algorithm/procedure) |
Property of | Properties of real numbers; properties of prime numbers; properties of arithmetic |
Rules of | Rules of arithmetic; rules of algebra; rules of calculus; rules of complex arithmetic; rules of positional chess |
Strategy for | Strategies for productivity; strategies for happiness; strategies for getting a good night's sleep |
