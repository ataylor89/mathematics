# important prefixes

My family taught me many important prefixes in the English language, that we often use in reasoning and analytical thinking.

I'll share these prefixes in a table, along with some examples.

| Prefix | Examples |
-------- | ---------|
List of | List of instructions; list of statements; list of steps; list of arguments |
Property of | Properties of real numbers; properties of prime numbers; properties of arithmetic |
Risk of | I may or may not give examples... but it suffices to say... this phrase is an important phrase in logic and reasoning |
Rules of | Rules of arithmetic; rules of algebra; rules of calculus; rules of complex arithmetic; rules of positional chess |
Strategy for | Strategies for productivity; strategies for happiness; strategies for getting a good night's sleep |
