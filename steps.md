# steps

We can think of our journey through math as a series of steps

The first step is numbers  
The second step is arithmetic  
The third step is algebra  
The fourth step is geometry

This is one way of enumerating the steps  
But there are other ways  
We can really think of our mathematical journey as a series of steps
