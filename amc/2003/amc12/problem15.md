# AMC12 2003 Problem 15

Problem: A semicircle of diameter 1 sits at the top of a semicircle of diameter 2, as shown. The shaded area inside the smaller semicircle and outside the larger semicircle is called a lune. Determine the area of this lune.

Solution:

This is a nice problem

The area of the "sliver" is equal to the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle within the sector

We can draw an equilateral triangle, such that the top side is the base of the smaller semicircle

It's an equilateral triangle... because the larger semicircle has a radius of 1, and the smaller semicircle has a base/diameter of 1

Because we are working with an equilateral triangle, the angles are 60 degrees each

This means that the area of the sector is 1/3 the area of the larger semicircle

The area of the larger semicircle is (Pi)(r^2)/2

    A = (Pi)(r^2)/2
      = (Pi)(1^2)/2
      = Pi/2

The area of the sector is 1/3 the area of the larger semicircle

    A = Pi/6

So we calculated the area of the sector, which is Pi/6

Now let's calculate the area of the equilateral triangle within the sector

    A = (1/2)bh
      = (1/2)(2 * sin 30)(cos 30)
      = (1/2)(2 * 1/2)(sqrt(3)/2)
      = sqrt(3)/4

The area of the equilateral triangle is sqrt(3)/4

Now we can calculate the area of the sliver

    A = A_sector - A_triangle
      = Pi/6 - sqrt(3)/4
      = (2*Pi - 3*sqrt(3))/12

The area of the lune is equal to the area of the smaller semicircle minus the area of the sliver

    A = A_semicircle - A_sliver
      = (Pi)(r^2)/2 - A_sliver
      = (Pi)(1/2)^2/2 - (2*Pi - 3*sqrt(3))/12
      = Pi/8 - (2*Pi - 3*sqrt(3))/12
      = 3*Pi/24 - (4*Pi - 6*sqrt(3))/24
      = (-Pi + 6*sqrt(3))/24
      = sqrt(3)/4 - Pi/24

So the answer is sqrt(3)/4 - Pi/24, which corresponds to choice C

I really like this problem...

We need to find some strategy for calculating the area of the "sliver"

The strategy is to calculate the area of the sector, and then to subtract the area of the equilateral triangle within the sector

Once we have the area of the sliver, we can calculate the area of the lune

The area of the lune is equal to the area of the smaller semicircle minus the area of the sliver

So we form a strategy for solving this problem

Then we solve the problem methodically, step by step

I'm listening to music by Enya

I really like the songs May it be and Only time

I just switched to the music video "May it be" on YouTube

I'm listening to "May it be"

It's a very beautiful song

The lyrics are very beautiful, too

Thanks for reading
