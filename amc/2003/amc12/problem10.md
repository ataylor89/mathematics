# AMC12 2003 Problem 10

Problem: Al, Bert, and Carl are the winners of a school drawing for a pile of Halloween candy, which they are to divide in a ratio of 3 : 2 : 1, respectively. Due to some confusion they come at different times to claim their prizes, and each assumes he is the Ô¨Årst to arrive. If each takes what he believes to be his correct share of candy, what fraction of the candy goes unclaimed?

Solution:

The problem statement is a little confusing...

Let's assume that Al arrives first, Bert arrives second, Carl arrives third

Let T be the total amount of candy

We can write the equation 3x + 2x + x = T

Al won first place, so his portion of T is 3x

Let's solve for 3x

    3x + 2x + x = T
    6x = T
    3x = T/2

Al takes T/2 of the total candy, which leaves an amount of T/2 left over

Then Bert arrives

The remaining amount of candy is T/2, so we can write the equation 3x + 2x + x = T/2

Bert won second place, so his portion of T/2 is 2x

Let's solve for 2x

    3x + 2x + x = T/2
    6x = T/2
    2x = T/6

Bert takes T/6 of the remaining candy, which leaves an amount of 2T/6 or T/3 left over

Then Carl arrives

The remaining amount of candy is T/3, so we can write the equation 3x + 2x + x = T/3

Carl won third place, so his portion of T/3 is x

Let's solve for x

    3x + 2x + x = T/3
    6x = T/3
    x = T/18

Carl takes T/18 of the remaining candy, which leaves an amount of 5T/18 left over 

This means that 5/18 of the total candy goes unclaimed

The answer is 5/18

Now... what if they arrive in a different order?

What if Carl arrives first, Bert arrives second, and Al arrives third?

There are six possible permutations

We can try this logic for all six permutations, and see if we get the same answer

But that's a lot of work...

The exam is a multiple choice exam, and 5/18 is one of the choices

Let's see if we get the same answer with a different order of arrivals

Suppose Carl arrives first, Bert arrives second, Al arrives third

I'm going to run through this very quickly

    3x + 2x + x = T
    6x = T
    x = T/6

Carl takes T/6 which means there is 5T/6 left over

    3x + 2x + x = 5T/6
    6x = 5T/6
    2x = 5T/18

Bert takes 5T/18, which means there is 10T/18 left over

    3x + 2x + x = 10T/18
    6x = 10T/18
    3x = 10T/36
    3x = 5T/18

Al takes 5T/18, which means there is 5T/18 left over

It turns out... we get the same answer

So we got an answer of 5/18 for both orders of arrival

There are six possible orders of arrival

I could try the same logic for all six orders of arrival, but that would be a lot of work...

It would also take a lot of time

I'm going to check the answer to see if I got it right

My answer is 5/18

*checking*

I checked the answer, and I think the answer is 5/18

So... I think my answer is correct, and that the answer is 5/18

In other words, 5/18 of the candy goes unclaimed
