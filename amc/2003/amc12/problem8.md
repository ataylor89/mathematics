# AMC12 2003 Problem 8

Problem: What is the probability that a randomly drawn positive factor of 60 is less than 7?

Solution:

Let's write out the list of positive factors of 60

1. (1, 60)
2. (2, 30)
3. (3, 20)
4. (4, 15)
5. (5, 12)
6. (6, 10)

The positive factors of 60 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60

Half of these are less than seven

So the probability that a randomly drawn positive factor of 60 is less than 7 is 50%

The answer is 1/2
