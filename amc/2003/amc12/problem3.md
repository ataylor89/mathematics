# AMC12 2003 Problem 3

Problem: A solid box is 15 cm by 10 cm by 8 cm. A new solid is formed by removing a cube 3 cm on a side from each corner of this box. What percent of the original volume is removed?

Solution:

We form a new solid by removing a 3x3x3 cm cube from each corner of the box.

The volume of each cube that we remove is 27 cm^3.

The volume of the original box is... 

15 x 10 x 8 cm^3 
= 15 x 80 cm^3 
= (10 + 5) x 80 cm^3
= (800 + 400) cm^3
= 1200 cm^3

We remove eight cubes of volume 27 cm^3 from the original box (since the box has eight corners), so we remove 8*27 = 216 cm^3 from the original box.

The percentage of the original box that gets removed is...

216/1200
= 8*27/1200
= 27/150
= 9/50
= 18/100
= 18%

Thus 18% of the original volume is removed.
