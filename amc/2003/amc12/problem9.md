# AMC12 2003 Problem 9

Problem: A set S of points in the xy-plane is symmetric about the origin, both coordinate axes, and the line y = x. If (2, 3) is in S, what is the smallest possible number of points in S?

Solution:

I used graphing paper to solve this problem

I drew an xy coordinate system on graphing paper

I drew the line y = x on my graph

Then I drew the point (2, 3) on my graph

I reflected the point (2, 3) across the x-axis, the y-axis, and the origin

This gives me the points (-2, 3), (-2, -3), and (2, -3)

Then I reflected the point (2, 3) across the line y = x, which gives me the point (3, 2)

I reflected the point (3, 2) across the x-axis and the y-axis, which gives me the points (-3, 2) and (-3, -2)

Then I reflected the point (3, 2) across the origin, which gives me the point (-3, -2)

After doing so, there are 8 points on my graph

In order to make sure that my set S meets all of the requirements, I checked each point in S

I checked each point in S to see if its reflection across the x-axis, the y-axis, the origin, and the line y = x is present in S

It turns out... that the reflections are present in S, and S meets all the requirements of S

So the smallest possible number of points in S is 8

The answer is 8
