# AMC12 2003 Problem 2

Problem: Members of the Rockham Soccer League buy socks and T-shirts. Socks cost $4 per pair and each T-shirt costs $5 more than a pair of socks. Each member needs one pair of socks and a shirt for home games and another pair of socks and a shirt for away games. If the total cost is $2366, how many members are in the League?

Solution:

Listen

This is a really fun problem

We get to write an equation

We are going to write an equation and on the right hand side we will put 2366

How do we write the equation?

Well...

We can start by writing an equation using the English language

(number of pairs of socks purchased) * (cost of one pair of socks) + (number of T-shirts purchased) * (cost of one T-shirt) = $2,366

The problem tells us that socks cost $4 per pair

It also tells us that each T-shirt costs $5 more than a pair of socks... so each T-shirt costs $9

We can substitute these numbers into our equation

(number of pairs of socks purchased) * $4 + (number of T-shirts purchased) * $9 = $2,366

The problem tells us that each member needs two pairs of socks -- one for home games, and one for away games

So the number of pairs of socks purchased is twice the number of members

The problem also tells us that each member needs two T-shirts -- one for home games, and one for away games

So the number of T-shirts purchsaed is twice the number of members

We can create a variable n which represents the number of members of the Rockham Soccer League

In other words, let n be the number of members of the Rockham Soccer League

Then the number of pairs of socks purchased is 2n

Also, the number of T-shirts purchased is 2n

We can substitute 2n into our equation, where appropriate

2n * $4 + 2n * $9 = $2,366

2n * ($4 + $9) = $2,366

2n * $13 = $2,366

Now we can do long division

We can divide $2,366 by $13

        182
    13|2366
       13
       106
       104
         26

13 divided 2366 evenly, and the result is 182

2n = 182

Now I'm going to do 182/2 in my head...

n = 91

The answer is n = 91

In other words, there are 91 members in the Rockham Soccer League

It's important to point out...

There are many ways to solve this problem

There might be a shortcut

(There often is a shortcut)

So... it's often the case that... there are many ways to solve a problem

This is one solution

I'll just restate my answer one more time

The answer is n = 91, there are 91 members in the Rockham Soccer League

I enjoyed doing this problem...

I enjoyed writing an equation

We wrote an equation and we solved for n

So listen

This is actually an algebra problem, because we had to solve for an unknown

Algebra is the field of math concerned with solving for an unknown

We wrote an algebraic equation

We were able to restate the problem as an algebraic equation

We were able to formulate the problem as an algebraic equation, with one variable, a variable called n

Then we used the laws of algebra (or the rules of algebra) to solve for n

So we wrote an algebraic equation and we solved for n

We used the laws of algebra (or the rules of algebra) to solve for n

I wanted to point this out...

I think it's worth pointing out that this is an algebra problem

We are given a word problem

We are able to write a word problem as an algebraic equation

We are able to solve a word problem by solving an algebraic equation

So the answer is n = 91

There are 91 members in the Rockham Soccer League
