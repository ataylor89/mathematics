# AMC12 2003 Problem 4

Problem: It takes Mary 30 minutes to walk uphill 1 km from her home to school, but it takes her only 10 minutes to walk from school to home along the same route. What is her average speed, in km/hr, for the round trip?

Solution:

This is a nice problem

It's night

I'm listening to Tessa by Steve Jablonsky

So... Mary's home is 1 kilometer from her school

She walks uphill to get to school, and she walks downhill on the way back

The average speed, for the round trip, can be defined mathematically as

v_{avg} = total distance travelled / total time elapsed

The total distance travelled is 2 x 1 km = 2 kilometers

The total time elapsed is 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

Thus the average speed, for the round trip, can be written as:

    v_{avg} = total distance travelled / total time elapsed (step 1)
            = 2 kilometers / 40 minutes                     (step 2)
            = 1 kilometer / 20 minutes                      (step 3)
            = 3 kilometers / 60 minutes                     (step 4)
            = 3 kilometers / hour                           (step 5)

You can see that... in step two... we substituted the values that we calculated

In step three, we simplify the fraction

In step four, we multiply the numerator and denominator by three, effectively multiplying the fraction by a special form of one (3/3)

In step five, we substitute 1 hour for 60 minutes, to write the average speed in terms of the desired units (kilometers and hours)

So the answer is 3 kilometers per hour

Mary's average speed, for the round trip, is 3km/hr

Remember that distance is a measurement

(A measurement is a number accompanied by a unit of measurement, e.g. 3 km)

Time is also a measurement

Mary's average speed is the ratio of two measurements, distance over time

In order to solve this problem, we have to replace 60 minutes with 1 hour, because 60 minutes and 1 hour are equivalent measurements

We used some tricks to convert 2 km / 40 minutes to 3 km / 60 minutes

We multiplied the fraction by (1/2) / (1/2), a special form of one, and then by 3/3, a special form of one

This is equivalent to multiplying the original fraction by (3/2) / (3/2), which is also a special form of one

You can see that I did some mental math to arrive at the answer, 3 km / hr

We had to convert the unit of time from minutes to hours, and we were able to do this by manipulating fractions

So this problem gives us some training in rates, measurements, and fractions

It also teaches us the definition of average speed (total distance travelled over total time elapsed)

I think this is a good stopping point

Mary's average speed, for the round trip, is 3 kilometers per hour
