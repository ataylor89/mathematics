# AMC12 2003 Problem 14

Problem: Points K, L, M, and N lie in the plane of the square ABCD so that AKB, BLC, CMD, and DNA are equilateral triangles. If ABCD has an area of 16, find the area of KLMN. (You can find the graphic at https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4867_2003_amc_12ahsme)

Solution:

I solved this problem by hand, using pen, paper, and a clipboard

I took a picture of the solution with my phone

I'll include the picture below

You can see that it's really just a trigonometry problem

We can use trigonometry to get the base and height of each triangle

Then we can use the formula A = (1/2)bh to calculate the area of each triangle

We can sum the areas of the four equilateral triangles, the four isosceles triangles, and the square ABCD, to get the area of KLMN

I hope that my handwriting in the picture above is clear

My handwriting is a little messy

I'm a little self conscious to show my handwriting

But... now that I've crossed that bridge, I might be less afraid to show my handwriting in the future

I really enjoyed doing this problem

It teaches us trigonometry, and also, the angle sum formula, which I use to calculate the sine of 15 degrees and 105 degrees

The angle sum formula is really important

The Art of Problem Solving books have a geometric proof of the angle sum formula

The geometric proof is really interesting

You can see... the angle sum formula is very important

The angle sum formula helps us solve this problem

So, by doing this problem, we really learn, trigonometry, and the angle sum formula

How do we calculate the sine of 17 degrees? (It's hard to do this using the angle sum formula)

How do we calculate the sine of Pi/7 radians? (Once again, it's hard to do this using the angle sum formula)

Well listen

We can calculate the sine of any angle using the Taylor series for sin(x)

So that shows you...

In the field of trigonometry we have many important theorems, including, the angle sum formula, and the Taylor series for sin(x)

I think this is a good stopping point

I'm going to relax, put on a TV show or movie, listen to some music, and wind down

Thanks for reading

The weekend is approaching... I wish everyone a nice weekend
