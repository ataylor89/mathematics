# AMC12 2003 Problem 13

Problem: The polygon enclosed by the solid lines in the Ô¨Ågure consists of $ 4$ congruent squares joined edge-to-edge. One more congruent square is attached to an edge at one of the nine positions indicated. How many of the nine resulting polygons can be folded to form a cube with one face missing?

Solution:

I am going to solve this problem by visualizing all of the resulting polygons

For the purpose of our discussion, we can label each of the nine resulting polygons one through nine

The following results were obtained by visualization:

1. Polygon number 1 does not satisfy the given conditions
2. Polygon number 2 does not satisfy the given conditions
3. Polygon number 3 does not satisfy the given conditions
4. Polygon number 4 does satisfy the given conditions
5. Polygon number 5 does satisfy the given conditions
6. Polygon number 6 does satisfy the given conditions
7. Polygon number 7 does satisfy the given conditions
8. Polygon number 8 does satisfy the given conditions
9. Polygon number 9 does satisfy the given conditions

Our analysis shows that six of the nine resulting polygons can be folded to form a cube with one face missing

So the answer is 6
