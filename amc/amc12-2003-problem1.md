# AMC12 2003 Problem 1

Problem: What is the difference between the sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers and the sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers?

Solution:

The first question we have to ask is, do the counting numbers include zero?

It is common to say that the natural numbers include zero.

If you walk into a room, you can say, "I count zero books."

If you walk into a second room, and you see books on the shelf, you can say, "I count ten books."

So is zero a counting number? I think it is...

I hazard to guess... that zero is a counting number...

We can include zero as a counting number, and see if the solution is correct

But honestly, I'm afraid that the problem is unclear...

It's not clear whether zero is a counting number or not

It might be that, according to the specific exam, zero is not a counting number

So if we get the answer wrong the first time, we may have to attempt the problem a second time

You know what...

In my opinion, zero is a counting number

But honestly, I think the exam does not consider zero to be a counting number

So let's just say that the even counting numbers start with two, and the odd counting numbers start with one

Then we'll see if the solution is correct

The sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers is...

We can calculate the sum by taking the average of the first and last term, and multiplying the average by 2003

The first term is 2

The last term is 2 * 2003 = 4006

The average of 2 and 4006 is (2+4006)/2 = 2004

The sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers is 2003*2004 and we can leave it like this, because it's advantageous to write it in this form (you'll see why it's advantageous)

The sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers is...

The first term is 1

The last term is 2 * 2003 - 1

The average of the first term and last term is (1 + 2 * 2003 - 1)/2 = 2003

The sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers is 2003 * 2003

Now listen

The sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers is 2003 * 2004

The sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers is 2003 * 2003

The difference is 2003 * 2024 - 2003 * 2003 = 2003(2004-2003) = 2003(1) = 2003

So the answer is 2003

I just checked the answer, by reading the AoPS thread on this problem

The answer is correct

Listen

You might say, "There's a shortcut"

It turns out, there are shortcuts for doing this problem

A good exercise is this: find a shortcut

It's actually hard to find a shortcut, but there is a shortcut

Sometimes, there's a shortcut

So we did this problem the long way... by using the formula for arithmetic series

There is also a shortcut

I'll add one more thing

The problem is a multiple choice problem

We can discern, from the possible answers, that the sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers has to be greater than or equal to the sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers, which means...

Zero is not considered a counting exam in the scope of this exam

We can deduce, just by looking at the possible answers, that zero is not considered a counting number in the scope of this exam

If zero were considered a counting number, then the answer would be a negative number

Since all of the possible answers are nonnegative, we can deduce that zero is not a counting number, in the scope of this exam

So listen

It turns out...

We asked, at first, "Is zero a counting number?"

We can actually answer this question just by looking at the multiple choice answers

We can deduce, that in the scope of this exam, zero is not a counting number

That said, it is common to include zero as a natural number

It's not obvious whether zero is a counting number or not, but we can deduce the answer just by looking at the multiple choice solutions

So listen

I'll end this document by restating the answer

The answer is 2003

The sum of the first 2003 even counting numbers is 2003 * (2 + 2 * 2003)/2 = 2003 * 2004

The sum of the first 2003 odd counting numbers is 2003 * (1 + 2 * 2003 - 1)/2 = 2003 * 2003

The difference is 2003 * 2004 - 2003 * 2003 = 2003(2004-2003) = 2003

We did it the long way, but it's actually pretty straightforward

It teaches you how to calculate the sum of an arithmetic sequence

I know this document is long

Honestly, I'm a little self conscious, because the document is so long

I'm afraid that I am meandering...

But it really shows you my thought process

I had to scratch my head at the question, "Is zero a counting number?"

My instinct said, "In this exam it's not considered a counting number"

I was able to confirm this by looking at the multiple choice solutions

We can deduce that zero is not a counting number, in the scope of this exam, by looking at the multiple choice solutions

So listen

I'm a little embarrassed because this document is so long

But the answer is 2003

I wanted to show my thought process
