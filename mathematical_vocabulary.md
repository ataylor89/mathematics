# mathematical vocabulary

## Introduction

Mathematics is really my chosen profession.

It's important to know that bachelor's degrees, PhDs, and even medical degrees, are fake.

If you want to be a mathematician, then there is nothing in heaven or earth that can separate you from mathematics.

Mathematics is an ancient tradition like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Anyone can be a Jew.

Anyone can be a Christian.

Anyone can be a Muslim.

Anyone can be a mathematician.

In the table below, I'll define some important words from the field of mathematics.

## Mathematical vocabulary

| Word | Definition
|----- | ----------
| Algebra | Solving for an unknown; the study of equations; arithmetic with variables |
| Algorithm | A list of instructions |
| Analysis | Analysis is the rigorous study of mathematical objects (source: Analysis I by Terence Tao) |
| Argument | An argument is a series of statements that works toward a conclusion. |
| Arithmetic | Math using the basic arithmetic operations (e.g. + - * / powers roots and modulo) |
| Best case scenario | The best possible outcome |
| Best decision | The best possible decision |
| Best move | The best possible move |
| Calculus | Calculating a slope or an area; calculating a slope, area, or volume |
| Cauchy sequence | (1) A sequence of rational numbers aₙ is a Cauchy sequence if and only if for every rational ε > 0 there exists an integer N >= 0 such that \|aⱼ - aₖ\| <= ε for all j, k >= N (source: Analysis I by Terence Tao). (2) A sequence of rational numbers is a Cauchy sequence iff for all ε > 0 there exists an index after which any two elements are epsilon-close. (3) Cauchy sequences are a tool that helps us construct real numbers. Cauchy sequences are the next best thing to convergent sequences. The rational sequence that approximates the square root of two does not converge in the rational numbers (because square root of two is not rational). But it has a special property that it shares with other sequences that approximate irrational numbers. It has the property that is stated in the definition of a Cauchy sequence. We find that Cauchy sequences are the common denominator, the common characteristic, of rational sequences that approximate irrational numbers. For this reason we say, Cauchy sequences are the next best thing to convergence. (4) A real number is simply the equivalence class of a Cauchy sequence. After giving it this definition, we can define arithmetic on Cauchy sequences, and then we can prove that the square root of two is the limit of a real-valued Cauchy sequence, in the traditional sense of limit, that is, lim n->∞ aₙ = sqrt(2) for any Cauchy sequence aₙ that has sqrt(2) as its equivalence class. It's important to keep in mind that some Cauchy sequences, but not all, converge in the rational numbers, whereas every Cauchy sequence converges in the real numbers. (5) To make a long story short, Cauchy sequences are a tool that helps us construct real numbers, and every real number can be defined as the equivalence class of a Cauchy sequence. First we define real numbers as the equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences. Then we prove that every real number is the limit of a real-valued Cauchy sequence, using the epsilon-N definition of a limit. (When we add two real numbers we are really adding two Cauchy sequences, and showing that the result is equal to a third Cauchy sequence. Same with subtraction, multiplication, and division. We can define arithmetic on sequences to allow us to do arithmetic on real numbers. That is my understanding of how it works. It's very detailed, it's very thorough, because I want to give a clear picture of how I understand real arithmetic and real numbers.) |
| Combinatorics | The field of mathematics concerned with counting |
| Confidence | Confidence is a measurement of how certain you are (a percentage from 0% to 100%) |
| Cost benefit analysis | We can measure the cost and benefit of a decision |
| Decision tree | A tree of possible decisions. It's important for the list/tree to be psychologically safe. |
| Definite integral | Let f(x) be a real-valued function that is continuous on the closed interval [a, b]. The definite integral of f(x) from a to b is the rectangle approximation of the area under the curve as the number of rectangles approaches infinity. This rectangle approximation is often called a Riemann sum. The area under the curve is bounded by x=a, x=b, f(x), and y=0. |
| Derivative | The derivative of a function f is a function f' such that f'(x) = lim h->0 (f(x+h) - f(x))/h at every x in the domain of f where the limit is defined. (Source: Art of Problem Solving Calculus) |
| Evidence | Data that supports a claim (e.g. there is a lot of evidence for the theory of gravity) |
| Expected value | The expected value formula is E(x) = Σ P(xᵢ) * xᵢ, where P(xᵢ) is the probability of the ith possible outcome, and xᵢ is the value associated with the ith possible outcome. Expected value has applications in many situations. Sometimes we say "The expected value is positive". For example, the expected value of removing an unnecessary import from a Python program is positive, because there is a chance that it will save memory, and it certainly does not cost any memory. Remember that code has to be loaded into memory before it can be run by the processor. So when we import a Python module it gets loaded into memory. By this logic, it makes sense that removing an unnecessary import can save us memory. There's a chance that it will, and it doesn't cost us any memory. So the expected value is positive. |
| Expected value argument | An argument based on expected value |
| Fact | A truth; a certainty |
| Formula | A formula is an equation or part of an equation. (E.g. Pi r squared is a formula for the area of a circle of radius r.) |
| Gaussian elimination | A concise, efficient method for solving a system of linear equations, in which we perform row operations on an augmented matrix. (It can also be used to invert a matrix, if the matrix is invertible.) |
| Idea | An idea is a word or phrase; an idea is a word, phrase, or sentence |
| Integer | An integer is an expression of the form a - b, where a and b are natural numbers (source: Analysis I by Terence Tao). |
| Limit | (1) The limit of a real-valued function f(x) as x approaches a is equal to L if for all e > 0 there exists a d > 0 such that 0 < \|x - a\| < d implies \|f(x) - L\| < e. (2) The limit of an infinite sequence aₙ as n approaches infinity is equal to L if for all ε > 0 there exists a positive integer N such that |aₙ - L| < ε for all n > N. (3) Limits are the trick that lets you calculate a slope or an area. |

A natural number is zero or any number that can be obtained from zero by incrementing (source: Analysis I by Terence Tao). |
| Notation | A notation is a language (e.g. mathematical notation, decimal notation, hexadecimal notation, chess notation, algebraic notation, descriptive notation) |
| Number theory | The study of numbers |
| Outcome tree | A tree of possible outcomes. It's important for the list/tree to be psychologically safe. |

| Real number | A real number is a point on the number line; a real number is an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences; a real number is the limit of a Cauchy sequence. We use sequences to approximate numbers like Pi or sqrt(2), which is why we can think of a real number as a sequence of rational numbers. Intuitively, a real number is a sequence of rational numbers or a point on the number line. |

A system is a set (e.g. the decimal system, the base ten number system). A system is a set of parts that work together and form a whole (e.g. digestive system, respiratory system, immune system, nervous system, cardiovascular system, operating system, computer system). |
