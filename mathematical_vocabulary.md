# mathematical vocabulary

## Introduction

Mathematics is really my chosen profession.

It's important to know that bachelor's degrees, PhDs, and even medical degrees, are fake.

If you want to be a mathematician, then there is nothing in heaven or earth that can separate you from mathematics.

Mathematics is an ancient tradition like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Anyone can be a Jew.

Anyone can be a Christian.

Anyone can be a Muslim.

Anyone can be a mathematician.

In the table below, I'll define some important words from the field of mathematics.

## Mathematical vocabulary

| Best case scenario | The best possible outcome |
| Best decision | The best possible decision |
| Best move | The best possible move |
| Calculus | Calculating a slope or an area; calculating a slope, area, or volume |
| Cauchy sequence | A sequence of rational numbers a(n) is a Cauchy sequence if and only if for every rational e > 0 there exists an integer N >= 0 such that \|a(j) - a(k)\| <= e for all j, k >= N (source: Analysis I by Terence Tao); a sequence of rational numbers is a Cauchy sequence iff for all epsilon > 0 there exists an index after which any two elements are epsilon-close |

| Confidence | Confidence is a measurement of how certain you are (a percentage from 0% to 100%) |
| Cost benefit analysis | We can measure the cost and benefit of a decision |
| Decision tree | A tree of possible decisions. It's important for the list/tree to be psychologically safe. |
| Definite integral | Let f(x) be a real-valued function that is continuous on the closed interval [a, b]. The definite integral of f(x) from a to b is the rectangle approximation of the area under the curve as the number of rectangles approaches infinity. This rectangle approximation is often called a Riemann sum. The area under the curve is bounded by x=a, x=b, f(x), and y=0. |
| Derivative | The derivative of a function f is a function f' such that f'(x) = lim h->0 (f(x+h) - f(x))/h at every x in the domain of f where the limit is defined. (Source: Art of Problem Solving Calculus) |
| Evidence | Data that supports a claim (e.g. there is a lot of evidence for the theory of gravity) |
| Expected value | The risk-reward vector; the cost-benefit vector; the probability-outcome vector; a weighted average of all possible outcomes, i.e. E(x) = Σ P(xᵢ) * xᵢ where xᵢ is the value associated with the i-th possible outcome |
| Expected value argument | An argument based on expected value |
| Fact | A truth; a certainty |
| Formula | A formula is an equation or part of an equation (e.g. Pi r squared is a formula for the area of a circle of radius r) |
| Gaussian elimination | A concise, efficient method for solving a system of linear equations, in which we perform row operations on an augmented matrix. (It can also be used to invert a matrix, if the matrix is invertible.) |
| Idea | An idea is a word or phrase |
| Integer | An integer is an expression of the form a-b, where a and b are natural numbers (source: Analysis I by Terence Tao) |
| Limit | (1) The limit of a real-valued function f(x) as x approaches a is equal to L if for all e > 0 there exists a d > 0 such that 0 < \|x - a\| < d implies \|f(x) - L\| < e. (2) Limits are the trick that lets you calculate a slope or an area. |

| Model | A model is a system; a model is a pattern; a model is a system that can be used to explain things or predict things (e.g. a model for predicting the weather); a model is a concrete representation of something abstract (e.g. there are many models of education) |
| Natural number | A natural number is any element of the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...} (source: Analysis I by Terence Tao); a natural number is any number defined by the Peano axioms; a natural number is zero or any number that can be obtained from zero by incrementing (source: Analysis I by Terence Tao) |
| Notation | A notation is a language (e.g. mathematical notation, decimal notation, hexadecimal notation, chess notation, algebraic notation, descriptive notation) |
| Number theory | The study of numbers |
| Outcome tree | A tree of possible outcomes. It's important for the list/tree to be psychologically safe. |
| Parser | A parser breaks a whole into its parts; a parser breaks a word, sentence, or file into its parts; the word "parser" comes from the Latin word "pars, partis" which means "part" or "parts" |
| Pattern | A pattern is something that repeats |
| Possibility tree | A tree of possibilities. It's important for the tree of possibilities to be psychologically safe. |
| Prediction | A guess about what will happen |
| Prime number | A positive integer greater than one that is only divisible by one and itself |
| Probability | The chance or likelihood that something will happen |
| Proof | A correct argument; an argument that is correct; a sequence of statements that demonstrates a conclusion is true; a sequence of steps that demonstrates a conclusion is true |
| Property | A property is a thing that belongs to another thing (e.g. properties of real numbers, properties of arithmetic) |
| Provenance | What came before (e.g. it is so hard to explain the provenance of that tweet) |
| Rational number | A rational number is an expression of the form a/b, where a and b are integers and b is non-zero (source: Analysis I by Terence Tao) |

| System | A system is a list (e.g. system of linear equations); a system is a procedure (e.g. long addition is a system for adding numbers); a system is a list of instructions or a list of steps; a system is a set; a system is a set of parts that work together and form a whole (e.g. digestive system, respiratory system, immune system, nervous system, cardiovascular system, operating system, computer system) |
| The fundamental theorem of algebra | Let P(x) be a polynomial of degree n, where n is a positive integer. Then P(x) has exactly n complex roots and P(x) = 0 has exactly n complex solutions. |
