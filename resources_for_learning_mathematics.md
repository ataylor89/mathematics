# resources for learning mathematics

I wanted to point out many resources for learning mathematics

I can update this document over time, and add new resources to the list

Here is a list of resources for learning mathematics:

1. The Art of Problem Solving e-books: https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/online
    - These e-books help you solve problems on the AMC, AIME, and Putnam exams
2. Contest problems: https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c3510133_maa_amc
    - The AMC8, AMC10, and AMC12 exams are good exams to start with
    - AMC problems are hard... and AIME problems are even harder
3. Mathcounts exams: https://mathcounts.org/resources/past-competitions
    - Mathcounts problems are really fun
    - On average, Mathcounts problems are easier than AMC problems, but...
    - The hardest Mathcounts problems are very difficult and they're more difficult than most AMC problems
4. Learning a programming language teaches you a lot about mathematics (e.g. Python, Java, C/C++, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc)
5. Learning chess teaches you a lot about mathematics (finding the best move or the best moves, tactics, strategy, endgames, etc)
6. Alcumus: https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus
    - Alcumus lets you solve math problems online, one by one
    - Alcumus is as fun, and as instructive, as the AMC/AIME/Putnam exams
    - I'm really grateful for Alcumus and I love using Alcumus in my spare time
