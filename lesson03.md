## Lesson 3: Arithmetic; the rules of arithmetic; the properties of real numbers

I'm listening to Hurricane by Fleurie while I write this

So we have many systems for writing numbers

(A number system is a system for writing numbers)

Now we need a system for adding numbers

Here's an exercise

What is 5 + 6?

It might be that you've already memorized the answer to this question

It might be that you already know that 5 + 6 = 11

But if you haven't memorized the answer, we can use a trick

We can use the substitution property and substitute 5 + 1 for 6

5 + 6 = 5 + (5 + 1)

Now we can use the associative property

5 + 6 = (5 + 5) + 1

It's a lot easier to add five plus five, so let's do that

5 + 6 = 10 + 1

We are also able to add ten plus one

5 + 6 = 11

You might be saying, "I already know that five plus six equals eleven... I don't need to go through that long process"

Well, that's a good point

Perhaps you have memorized the addition table for one through nine

You might know the answer to x + y for all integers x, y between 1 and 10

But listen

It is very easy to forget what 8 + 9 is

If you forget what 8 + 9 is, you can use this trick

8 + 9 = 8 + (2 + 7)

We use the substitution property to get the above equation

8 + 9 = (8 + 2) + 7

We use the associative property to get the above equation

8 + 9 = 10 + 7

8 + 9 = 17

So if you haven't memorized the addition table for one through nine... then these tricks might help

We learned about the substitution property of equality

We learned about the associative property for addition of real numbers

Let's try a harder exercise

What is 327 + 468?

Well, the addition table for one through nine isn't going to help us solve this problem

(It helps but it's not enough)

We can actually use the tricks we learned

327 + 468 = (325 + 2) + 468

We used the substitution property to get the equation above

327 + 468 = 325 + (2 + 468)

We used the associative property to get the above equation

327 + 468 = 325 + 470

We made the problem a lot easier, but there's still more work to be done

325 + 470 = 300 + 25 + 400 + 70

We used the substitution property to get the above equation

325 + 470 = 300 + 400 + 25 + 70

We used the commutative property to get the above equation

325 + 470 = (300 + 400) + (25 + 70)

We used the associative property

325 + 470 = 700 + 95

325 + 470 = 795

Finally, we have an answer

We were able to add 327 and 468

We wrote a series of equations to calculate the result

We used the substitution property, the commutative property, and the associative property

We can actually use these tricks in our head, and solve the problem by means of mental arithmetic

I learned mental arithmetic at a young age

My mom and I did a lot of mental arithmetic when I was a child

We can solve this problem using mental arithmetic

When we use mental arithmetic, we can use the tricks that we learned, including, the substitution, commutative, and associative properties

But listen

There's another way to solve this problem

We can also use long addition

In the next lesson we will calculate 327 + 468 using long addition

Long addition is a system for adding large numbers

It is really useful to learn long addition

If you know long addition, you can add any numbers

I want to end this lesson by making one thing clear

We actually have many systems for adding numbers

We can manipulate an expression using the properties of real numbers

We can manipulate an expression using the rules of arithmetic

Honestly, I think that "rules of arithmetic" is a really useful phrase

We can manipulate an expression using the rules of arithmetic

We can use the substitution rule, the associative rule, the commutativity rule

That's what we did in our series of equations

We used the rules of arithmetic to manipulate an expression

327 + 468 = 300 + 27 + 400 + 68

We were able to write that equation using the rules of arithmetic

We used the substitution rule to write that equation

Then we swapped the middle two terms

We made use of the commutativity rule

327 + 468 = 300 + 400 + 27 + 68

Then we added parentheses

We made use of the associativity rule

327 + 468 = (300 + 400) + (27 + 68)

Now we can simplify

327 + 468 = 700 + (27 + 68)

We can apply the substitution rule once again

327 + 468 = 700 + (25 + 2 + 68)

We can apply the associativity rule once again

327 + 468 = 700 + 25 + (2 + 68)

Now let's simplify

327 + 468 = 700 + 25 + 70

327 + 468 = 700 + 95

327 + 468 = 795

Listen

I know I have written a lot in this document

What is the main point?

What are the main points?

Well, in writing this document I really discovered a useful phrase

I started by saying, "We can use the substitution property of equality, the associative property of addition of real numbers, et cetera"

But then I ended by saying, "We can actually use the rules of arithmetic"

Arithmetic has rules, just like algebra and calculus

We can master the rules of arithmetic

We can master the rules of algebra

We can master the rules of calculus

It's a lot easier to say "rules of arithmetic" than to say "substitution property of equality, associative property of addition, etc"

We can really figure out 327 + 468 just by using the rules of arithmetic

We can solve this problem on paper

We can solve this problem in our heads

There is more than one system for adding numbers

One way to add two numbers is to manipulate the expression using the rules of arithmetic

A second way to add two numbers is to use long addition

In the next lesson we will cover long addition

Long addition is a system for adding two numbers

If we want to add the numbers 3681238 and 38649743, the easiest way to do so is to use a calculator or use long addition

If we don't have a calculator on hand, we can use long addition

It's actually quite difficult to calculate 3681238 + 38649743 just by arithmetic manipulations

Some problems are best suited to long addition

We can calculate 327 + 468 through arithmetic manipulations

But to calculate 3681238 + 38649743, we need to use long addition, or we need to use a calculator

I wanted to start by teaching my reader the rules of arithmetic

I wanted to end by introducing the subject of long addition

In the next lesson we will learn long addition

Long addition is a system that we use to add two numbers

Listen...

I want to impart this wisdom

We can be very grateful for our education

We can be very grateful that we know the decimal system

We can be very grateful that we know arithmetic

We can be very grateful that we know the rules of arithmetic

We can be very grateful that we know long addition

We can be very grateful that we know a number system

There's a lot that we can do with a number system, including long addition
