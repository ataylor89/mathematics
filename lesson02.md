# Lesson 2

I want each lesson to be very valuable, very useful

So let's get started and not waste time :)

How many number systems do you know?

I know (and use) four number systems

I know (and use) decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and also the tally number system

Here is an exercise...

Write the number twelve in decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and also tally

As an example, I'll write the number seventeen in decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and tally

In tally, the number seventeen can be written as ||||| ||||| ||||| ||

In decimal, the number seventeen can be written as 17

In hexadecimal, the number seventeen can be written as 11 (or 0x11 to clearly indicate that it's hexadecimal)

In binary, the number seventeen can be written as 10001 (or 0b10001 to clearly indicate that it's binary)

So listen

We just wrote the number seventeen in decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and tally

Now you can write the number twelve using these number systems

You can see that...

We can easily write small numbers like seventeen using the tally number system

But to write larger numbers like nine hundred sixty, it is easier to use positional number systems like decimal, hexadecimal, or binary

So one of the main points of this lesson is this...

Positional number systems (like decimal, hexadecimal, and binary) allow us to easily write large numbers like nine hundred sixty

Here's an exercise for you

Write the number nine hundred sixty in decimal, hexadecimal, and binary

I won't ask you to write it in tally, because it could take a very long time

But if you want to write it in tally, you can write a Python program that does it for you

Listen

We are nearing the end of our second lesson

There's one more point I want to make

When we write the number one as "one", what number system are we using?

We are actually using the English language to write numbers

English has its own naming system (nomenclature) for numbers

We can use the English language to write numbers

One hundred sixty seven thousand, two hundred thirty four is less concise than 167,234

It's also a lot less easy to read

It's much easier to read and understand 167,234

So we can use the English language to write small numbers

We can say there are twelve trees in a garden, and two of them are oak trees

But if we take a census of the number of citizens in a city, then we might want to use the decimal system

We can say there are 167,234 citizens in a city

It's a lot easier than saying there are one hundred sixty seven thousand, two hundred thirty four citizens in a city

So the English language gives us a fifth number system we can use

We can write numbers in English

Let's review

I know (and use) five number systems

I can write numbers in decimal, hexadecimal, binary, tally, and also in the English language

How many number systems do you know and use?
