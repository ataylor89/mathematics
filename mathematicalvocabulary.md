# mathematical vocabulary

## Introduction

Mathematics is really my chosen profession.

It's important to know that bachelor's degrees, PhDs, and even medical degrees, are fake.

If you want to be a mathematician, then there is nothing in heaven or earth that can separate you from mathematics.

Mathematics is an ancient tradition like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Anyone can be a Jew.

Anyone can be a Christian.

Anyone can be a Muslim.

Anyone can be a mathematician.

In the table below, I'll define some important words from the field of mathematics.

## Mathematical vocabulary

| Word | Definition
|----- | ----------
| Algebra | The field of mathematics concerned with solving for an unknown or solving equations; the study of equations |
| Algorithm | A list of instructions |
| Argument | A list of statements or a sequence of statements; a list of steps or a sequence of steps |
| Arithmetic | The study of numbers and numerical operations |
| Best case scenario | The best possible outcome |
| Calculus | The field of mathematics concerned with calculating a slope, area, or volume |
| Combinatorics | The field of mathematics concerned with counting |
| Cost benefit analysis | We can measure the cost and benefit of a decision |
| Decision tree | A tree of possible decisions. It's important for the list/tree to be psychologically safe. |
| Expected value | A vector of measurements that helps us determine expected value; the (cost, benefit) vector; the (risk, reward) vector |
| Expected value argument | An argument based on expected value |
| Fact | A truth; a certainty |
| Limit | (1) The limit of a real-valued function f(x) as x approaches a is equal to L if for all e > 0 there exists a d > 0 such that 0 < \|x - a\| < d implies \|f(x) - L\| < e. (2) Limits are the trick that lets you calculate a slope or an area. |
| Linear algebra | The study of linear equations |
| List of possibilities | A list of possibilities is useful when analyzing a person or situation. It's important for the list of possibilities to be psychologically safe. |
| Logical argument | A series of logical statements |
| Matrix | A rectangular array of numbers |
| Measurement | A number accompanied by a unit of measurement; a number and a unit (e.g. 100 yards, 24 hours, 100 gigabytes) |
| Model | A model is an explanation; a model can explain something or make predictions; a model is a pattern |
| Number theory | The study of numbers |
| Parser | A parser breaks a whole into its parts; a parser breaks a word, sentence, or file into its parts; the word "parser" comes from the Latin word "pars, partis" which means "part" or "parts" |
| Pattern | A pattern is something that repeats |
| Possibility tree | A tree of possibilities is useful when analyzing a person or situation. It's important for the tree of possibilities to be psychologically safe. |
| Prime number | A positive integer greater than one that is only divisible by one and itself |
| Probability | The study of chance, likelihood, or probability |
| Proof | A correct argument; an argument that is correct; a sequence of statements that demonstrates a conclusion is true; a sequence of steps that demonstrates a conclusion is true |
| Property | A property is a thing that belongs to another thing (e.g. properties of real numbers, properties of arithmetic) |
| Rationale | A reason or an argument |
| Risk | A probability; a probability measurement from 0% to 100% |
| Risk comparison | Comparing the (risk, reward) vectors of two different decisions; comparing the risk profiles of two different decisions |
| Risk reward analysis | We can measure the risk and reward of a decision |
| The fundamental theorem of algebra | Let P(x) be a polynomial of degree n, where n is a positive integer. Then P(x) has exactly n complex roots and P(x) = 0 has exactly n complex solutions. |
| The fundamental theorem of arithmetic | Every positive integer greater than one has a unique prime factorization |
| The fundamental theorem of calculus | Let f(x) be a real-valued function that is continuous on the closed interval [a, b]. Then the definite integral of f(x) from a to b is equal to F(b) - F(a), where F is any antiderivative of f. |
| Theory | A hypothesis |
| Trigonometry | The study of triangles |
| Vector | A list of numbers |
| Worst case scenario | I have OCD so it hurts that this is the last word in my mathematical glossary but listen, we need to find a word that starts with a letter after w, or a word that comes after this word (alphabetically). It suffices to say that worst case scenario does not need a definition. I have OCD so I think that this long treatise is enough and it really is the case that best case worst case analysis is a useful tool in analysis and reasoning. |
| Xylophone | The xylophone is an instrument I want to learn |
| Zero | The number zero is very useful in mathematics. Zero is the additive identity. |
